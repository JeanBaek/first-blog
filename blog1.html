         Jean is a woman, 24 years old, who given birth and raised for 21 years in Seoul, South Korea.
         </p>
         <p>
         She have been enjoying singing, dancing since she was 3 years old I remember.
         So naturally she had started dreaming to be a singer.
         </p>
         <p>
         However her mother had not want her to be a singer because it is such a tough job.
         </p>
         <p>
         But Jean have persuaded her mother, and had started training to be a singer.<br>
         She went to an Academy for singing and dancing, <br>
         she had a number of Auditions.
         </p>
         <p>
         But it was not easy to be the one. <br>
         She had changed her way to be a musical actress.
         </p>
         <p>
         She has found her talent in stages, <br>
         that she is good at singing, pronounciation, and showing a deep feelings.
         </p>
         <p>
         However, she couldn’t get into a university for the talent<br>
         which made her too disappointed to remain living in her homeland.
         </p>
         <p>
         So, she moved.<br>
         To a country she thinks the most far from her homeland.
