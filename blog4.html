          <p>
          I desire to work alone as a freelancer.<br>
          Since Corona-pandemic is spreaded over the world so badly, <br>my company had made staffs to work in their own home.
          </p>
          <p>
          This experience reminded and assured me <br>that I can achieve higher efficiency and performance when I work alone. <br>
          Especially, I am more stable and peaceful in the emotional way when I work alone.
          </p>
          <p>
          Therefore I want to work as a freelancer and digital nomad in a field of programming. <br>
          I also expect to live in overseas such as Dublin, and Berlin.
